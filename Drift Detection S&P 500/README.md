# Prediction and Drift Detection in the S&P 500


Stakeholders and data scientists need to be vigilant in monitoring for data drift and be prepared to adapt their machine-learning models as needed to maintain their accuracy and effectiveness. After using testing windowing functions, statistical-based algorithms and time series to detect data drifts I finally settled with our time series model as it had a higher accuracy rate. Next I detected drift by comparing the actual values to the predicted values that were generated by our time series ARIMA model. After, I added our actual values in the original dataset to the predicted values that was generated in the data drift model provided by evidently. The time series model was not only able to detect drifts in our dataset but also was a great tool for predictive analysis. Compared to the other models tested it can confidently say that time series guarantees you promising results when detecting drifts.
